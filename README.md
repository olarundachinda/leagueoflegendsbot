## League of Legends Wrapped Tool

The League of Legends Wrapped Tool is designed to provide personalized game summaries for League of Legends players. 
Using the Riot API, it fetches and analyzes player data to generate daily and weekly performance reports. 
It presents insights with a mix of humor and analytics, making gameplay statistics more engaging and accessible.

## Author Vision
At the moment, my vision is to further develop this tool to maybe be a Discord bot that integrates AI and more but I am a full-time student taking 6 classes so I'm working on delegating my tasks wisely so I have more time to update the project and do more with it.
Below are the features I aim to add before the end of the month. However, they will gradually increase as I work more on the project.

## Key Features
- Automated Game Summaries: Fetches user data from the Riot API to generate concise, engaging reports.
- Humorous Analytics: Delivers stats in a fun and entertaining way.
- Interactive Queries: Allows users to ask questions about their game performance using natural language and SQL.
- Community Comparisons: Enables players to compare their stats with others in the same Discord server.

## Current Files
Below are the files I currently have in this repository:
- WebScraping Leaderboard: I will use this code to scrape the list of current challenger players in the leaderboard using Pandas, Selenium, Webdriver, and Beautiful Soop to a CSV file. I will use this to make requests to the Riot API and structure the outputs I
  am getting. I'm also trying to refine my SQL skills so having game data for a huge number of players helps me practice query solving.
- League_Extract: This file interacts with the Riot API to extract the necessary data for my project and organizes it into a Pandas DataFrame.
  While Iâ€™m still refining the final format, this version lays the groundwork. Additionally, I incorporated Community Dragon to properly map item names, summoner spells, and runes, ensuring they are displayed as readable names instead of numerical IDs.
